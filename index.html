        <h1><br>Software Projects</h1>
        <p1><br>I have worked with numerous programming languages for both Front-End and Back-End Development! <br>Front-End: JavaScript, HTML, CSS <br>Back-End: Python, Java, C++, C#, C <br><br>In addition to these programming languages, I have used different Developer Tools and IDEs like <br>VScode, Pycharm, Eclipse, Brackets, Code::Blocks, NetBeans, STM32CubeIDE, Arduino IDE, and CLion.<br><br><br><br><br></p1>

                <h3>Android Weather App</h3>
                <h4>Java</h4>
                <img src="images/weather.png">
                <p>This app displays the current weather, hourly temperatures, and windspeed of any city across the world with the use of global Weather API. JSON Object Request from the Volley libary was used in Android Studio to retrieve the API data. The UI was designed to be aesthetically pleasing.</p>

                <h3>Personal Portfolio Website</h3>
                <h4>HTML/CSS</h4>
                <img src="images/website.png">
                <p>This website was designed to optimize the user experience and simplify navigation. Interactive elements such as hovering animations and embedded hyperlinks for user convenience. Good formatting is maintained with the use of center, absolute, and relative positioning.</p>

                <h3>"Classic Pong" Game</h3>
                <h4>C#</h4>
                <img src="images/pong.png">
                <p>Using the Unity game engine, simple AI is implemented as the user plays against a CPU. The game does become progressively harder for the player. Different components of the UI were programmed with the UnityEngine namespace.</p>

                <h4>Java</h4>
                <img src="images/todo.png">
                <p>Programmed in Android Studio, the UI component is implemented (in a layout resource file) for a user-friendly experience. AppCompatActivity was used so older devices can access these app features. Methods were included to add or remove items from the list array.</p>

                <img src="images/music.png">
                <p>The layout was constructed to be easy and simple to use, from HTML and CSS. Programmed with JavaScript, this music player is able to display a progress bar, which can be controlled by the user, as well as the ability to pause and replay. Webkit was used to avoid browser compatibility issues.</p>

                <img src="images/snake.png">
                <p>This game has three classes that use JFrame, JPanel, and the ActionListener interface. Methods were implemented to generate a new location for the apple, check for a collision, determine if the game is over, etc. To move the snake, a loop was used to iterate through the body parts of the snake.</p>

                <img src="images/minesweeper.png">
                <p>Different functions were implemented into the setup of this game, such as create the board with specified dimensions, hide the board values, reveal values and neighbours on the board when clicked on, and clean the board when the game is done.</p>

                <img src="images/goalie.png">
                <p>This game was programmed using the Pygame library. The objective of this game is to save as many pucks from going into the net. As the user controls the goalie, pucks will randomly spawn every 5 seconds.</p>

                    <p>This device is designed to take sun radiation as input through the light sensor. 
                        <br>It is programmed to convert it into a UV index value (from 0-12) which will be displayed and updated on a LCD monitor, along informing the user how much skin protection is needed outside. 
                        <br>The STM32 Microcontroller was programmed in C, using the STM32Cube IDE. The outer structure was designed in AutoCAD and later 3D printed.</p>

                        <br>If the rover drives out of the pathway, it is able to relocate the pathway automatically. 
                        <br>A majority of the structure is 3D printed, along with Analog Line Sensors, DC Motors, and an Arduino. 
                        <br>The line sensors and motors on the wheels are programmed for automation through the Arduino, using C in the Arduino IDE.</p>
